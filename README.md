- The site demo was created using Vercel and can be viewed [Here](https://dev-challenges-404-page.vercel.app/)
- Whilst creating this site I managed to learn more about responsive web design.

- I believe I completed the challenge quite well. This was the first responsive design challenge I had ever taken on.
- The button on mobile isn't best optimised - needs to be fixed.
